      				<p>In midst of my usual mid night prayers and meditations of 26-28<sup>th</sup> November 1998, God began to unveil to me in a vision His burden and pain about the sufferings of His believers, their tears, pain, affliction and financial oppressions intentionally orchestrated by the devil to frustrate and cause many believers to doubt God’s love for them and at the same time making the mocking and unbelieving world ask where is the God of the believers.</p>
      				<p>How believers try but many never get results, lacking in every good things that makes for welfare and decent living that reflects them as God’s&nbsp; heavenly ambassador on earth.</p>
      				<p>SUDDENLY, I saw a big tree with many branches &nbsp;appeared before my eyes, enormous with very large ripe fruits ready to be harvested and eaten but underneath it’s very shaded branches, I saw a multitude of fainting, tired, hungry and some dying people , all of the groaning in pains of hunger and wishing there was food to eat.</p>
      				<p>I was surprised to notice that none of them had the energy and strength or wisdom to pluck to eat from the fruitful tree underneath which they all gather. The sight was so pathetic that I was moved to tears when suddenly my ears were open to hear the sounds of the songs the people began to sing;</p>
      				<p>“ WE DO NOT KNOW WHEN, WE DO NOT KNOW HOW HE WILL DO IT AGAIN!!!!!!!” ,</p>
      				<p>As I wept, the Voice of the Lord came to me referring me to EXODUS 3;1-9, HOSEA 4;6,PROVERBS 11;9, ROMANS 8;19-22, ISAIAH 42;6-9, ISAIAH 49;6-9 and He spoke to me saying “ this people you see are my people all over the world, they are in pains, anguish and sufferings, <strong>BUT I HAVE ALREADY MADE PROVISIONS FOR THEM, FOR THEIR WELFARE BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW IT OR SEE IT AND SO THE SUFFER AND DIE AND I AM OFFENDED BY THIS</strong>, but now I am going to send you to show them the ways to my provisions that I have made available”</p>
      				<p>This was my first time of hearing God this way. But not until 2004, the Lord told me open to John 4;34-38 ,then He said &nbsp;to me <strong>” NOW IS THE TIME, BE UPTO TIME, I AM SENDING TO &nbsp;RECUE MY PEOPLE FROM ALL THE SATANIC AFFLICTIONS &amp; IGNORANCE AND TO BRING THEM INTO MY ABUNDANCE THAT IA HAVE PLANNED FROM THE BIGENING OF THE WORLD, NOW AS YOU HEARD FROM ME EARLIER,NOW IS IT, IAM THE LORD.”</strong></p>
      				<p>From then on the vision has caught the attention of believing men and women who now pursue its mandate with God’s servant to see it find reality on the earth</p>

      				<p><u>JESUS THE FINANCIAL RESCUER&amp; YOKE BREAKER</u></p>
      				<p><strong>Despite intense contrary conditions, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all lived sufficiently in abundance and prosperity. The condition of the economies around and which they belonged could not stop their prosperity. This is supposed to be your story too in the midst of this present global financial hardship. As a child of God you have not just an all-weather –supplying source but also you are connected, let us provoke the covenant of your NEW BIRTH CONNECTION to ensure your rescue in the midst of this world financial chaos. Are you poor, struggling to live and poverty making your life difficult and you have done all you can with no improvements? </strong></p>
      				<p><strong>YOU SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH&amp;IT SHALL SET YOU FREE! WHERE EVERYTHING ELSE FAILS, THE COVENANT PREVAILS:</strong></p>
      				<p>Jesus not only saves from sin and heals people from sickness and diseases, JESUS ALSO BREAKS AND DESTROYS ALL KNDS OF FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS,CURSES &nbsp;AND DELIVERS FROM POVERTY AND ENRICHES HIS BELIEVERS just as God did for Abraham, Jacob, Isaac, job,.</p>
      				<p><strong>“you shall remember the lord your God for it is He who GIVES YOU POWER TO GET WEALTH, that He may establish His covenant which He sware to your fathers just as it is this day” Deut 8;18</strong></p>
      				<p>YOU ARE NOT BORN AGAIN TO BE WRETCHED AGAIN BUT TO E ENRICHED AGAIN.</p>
      				<p><strong>“You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though He was rich yet FOR YOUR SAKES HE BECAME POOR THAT YOU [ YOU,YOU,YOU] THROUGH HIS POVERTY MIGHT BECOME RICH” </strong></p>
      				<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 Corinthians 8;9</strong></p>
      				<p>YOU ARE BORN AGAIN NOT TO BE IN RAGS AGAIN BUT TO BE ENROBBED IN ROYALTY AGAIN TO THE GLORY OF GOD</p>
      				<p><strong>“ You are a chosen generation , a ROYAL priesthood, a holy nation ,A PECULIAR PEOPLE that you should show forth the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His MARVELOUS LIGHT.</strong></p>
      				<p>When the prodigal son RETURNED to his father [Depicting new birth], according to the scriptures, one of the most important things his father ordered TO BE DONE TO HIM WAS THE CHANGING OF HIS GARMENT FROM RAGS TO REAL ROYALTY [Luke 17]
      				</p>
      				<p>You are born again not to be in rags again but to be robed in royalty again.</p>
      				<p>The Father is eager to make you GLORIOUS as He is in GLORIOUS.</p>
      				<p>Jesus REPORTED in john 17;22 saying Father;</p>
      				<p><strong>“The GLORY THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME ,I HAVE GIVEN TO THEM..”</strong></p>
      				<p>Get set to be enriched, get set for kingdom financial glorification.</p>
      				<p><strong>DESTINED TO BE RICH</strong></p>
      				<p>God told me; “my people many of them know all the rules, principles and tips of prosperity and infact even some preaches eloquently about this, yet they never see anything to show for it BECAUSE THEY KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT IT EXCEPT THE TRUTH,MY TRUTH ABOUT PROSPERITY”</p>
      				<p>“My evidence of financial knowledge is financial freedom….nothing more.</p>
      				<p>A lot of my people wants to be free from poverty, reproaches and so they struggle, work hard and try&nbsp; hard to conquer poverty and reproach with their effort. It is not because they are not trying that they don’t get free, its because they do not KNOW MY TRUTH.</p>
      				<p>When My truth is KNOWN, freedom from poverty and reproaches become automatic, for I STEP IN THEN…..truth sets people free ON ITS OWN!!!!!!!</p>
      				<p><strong>“ and you SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH, and THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE” </strong></p>
      				<p><strong>&nbsp; [John 8;32 and Job 33;14-28]</strong></p>
